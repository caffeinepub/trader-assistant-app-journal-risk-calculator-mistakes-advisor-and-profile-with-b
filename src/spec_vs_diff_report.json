  "summary": "All four requested calculator-related updates appear to be implemented: calculator UI copy now presents as a lot size calculator, browser alerts were replaced with inline validation, pip value logic was deduplicated to use the shared pip-value utility, and the bottom nav label for the calculator tab was updated to “Lot Size.” There are also unrelated App-level refactors/changes that were not requested.",

      "description": "Refactor/changes to main App behavior unrelated to the calculator request (e.g., backend health-check/error classification handling and tab rendering/mounting logic changes).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on calculator tab copy/validation/pip-value logic and bottom-nav label only, and explicitly lists non-goals about auth/subscription/entitlement logic. The diff summary indicates broader App refactors beyond the requested UI label change.",
